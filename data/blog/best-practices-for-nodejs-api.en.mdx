### Introduction

Node.js is a good tool for building REST APIs. It is one of the [most popular](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies) techs among devs. **If you use Node.js or are learning Node.js to build REST APIs, this post is for you**.

This post describes a set of best practices for building [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/pt-br/) APIs with the [Express](https://expressjs.com) framework.

> Applying patterns and best practices in coding is essential. Patterns increase code readability and ease software support.

The set of best practices described below is the result of my experience.
I have experience building Node.js applications and teaching web development. And a lot of readings of technical books and blog posts.

[The complete code of all good practice examples is in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/jesielviana/nodejs-express-sequelize)
