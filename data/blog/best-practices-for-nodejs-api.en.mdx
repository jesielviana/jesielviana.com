### Introduction

Node.js is a good tool for building REST APIs. It is one of the [most popular](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies) techs among devs. **If you use Node.js or are learning Node.js to build REST APIs, this post is for you**.

This post describes a set of best practices for building [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/pt-br/) APIs with the [Express](https://expressjs.com) framework.

> Applying patterns and best practices in coding is essential. Patterns increase code readability and ease software support.

The set of best practices described below is the result of my experience.
I have experience building Node.js applications and teaching web development. And a lot of readings of technical books and blog posts.

[The complete code of all good practice examples is in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/jesielviana/nodejs-express-sequelize)

### 1 - Project structure

In Node.js applications, are generally used two types of directory structure:

- division by component
- division by technical role

In the division by component, the files are grouped by feature directory. See the example below:

```shell:projetc-structure
src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ courses/
        â”œâ”€â”€ courses.service.js
        â”œâ”€â”€ course.model.js
        â”œâ”€â”€ courses.routes.js
  â”œâ”€â”€ students/
        â”œâ”€â”€ students.service.js
        â”œâ”€â”€ student.model.js
        â”œâ”€â”€ students.routes.js
  â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
```

Structuring by technical roles, the files are grouped in the folders by layers, according to your responsibility. As you can see in the example below:

```shell:projetc-structure
src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ services/
        â”œâ”€â”€ courses.js
        â”œâ”€â”€ students.js
  â”œâ”€â”€ model/
        â”œâ”€â”€ course.js
        â”œâ”€â”€ student.js
  â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
        â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
        â”œâ”€â”€ courses.js
        â”œâ”€â”€ students.js
  â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
```

Between these two approaches, **I recommend structuring by technical role layer**. Yet, there is not the correct option. It is up to each project team to discuss and choose a default structure.

Based on structured by technical role layer, I organize my projects as follows:

```shell:projetc-structure
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js        the entry point for starting the server (network configurations)
src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ app.js         Express(http-server) config
  â”œâ”€â”€ api/           Express route handlers for all the endpoints of the app
  â”œâ”€â”€ config/        environment configurations
  â”œâ”€â”€ services/      service layer with the business logic
  â”œâ”€â”€ models/        model layer with database entities
test/
  â”œâ”€â”€ unit/          all the unit tests of the app
  â”œâ”€â”€ integration/   all the integration tests of the app
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json     main project configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ ...              others config files (.gitignore, jest.config, .sequelizerc, etc)
```

I recommend separating Express definitions from HTTP network configuration. I usually named `app` for Express definition and `server` for HTTP network configs and server startup (see example above).
The `server` file with network configurations (port, protocol, etc) and startup. And the `app` file with the express API configuration (routes, JSON, and middleware).
This allows testing the API in-process in an isolated test environment. It guarantees a better separation of concerns and a cleaner code.
